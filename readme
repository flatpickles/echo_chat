echo_chat
Matt Nichols (man1, snowli)

echo_chat consists of several simple C programs, written to demonstrate TCP socket communications in C, as well as the implementation of basic concurrency using both pthreads and the select syscall. 

The client uses a pthread for each sending and receiving messages from the server. There are three different servers: one uses select to handle many concurrent socket connections from different clients, one uses multiple threads, and one uses a single thread (non-concurrent). Messages are limited to 256 bytes in size, for simplicity.

Usage:
  client server_hostname port
  server listening_port
